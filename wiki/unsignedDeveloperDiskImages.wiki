#how to load unsigned disk images to /Developer via Xcode

= Howto =

will post the deets here soon


= Why =

To get access to /Developer/Library/Lockdown/ServiceAgents/com.apple* BEFORE they are READ and CACHED by xcode (they are cached :) )

= Why this isnt enough =

becuase if debugserver dosent checkin with lockdownd (if you remove its' argument) then it 'fails to start' and everything shuts down

what does this mean?

--we cant change its arguments without a fatal crash
--we cant patch debugserver without a fatal crash.

what is going on?!?!? i dont know why apple CRC's and checks debugserver is running correctly but they sure are protecting it heavily...
